# Phase 2.1: Cracking the Code

Let's finally get into React! Start by cloning the starter code:

    git clone https://github.com/gabrielsessions/onboarding-2024-phase2.git

Then, boot up a development server to get a sense of what the website looks like! \`cd\` (change directory) into the cloned repository and create a new branch.

    cd onboarding-2024-phase2
    git checkout main
    git checkout -b my-branch-name

We need to install some packages in order for React to work. You can install them by running \`npm install\` in the \`onboarding-2024-phase2\` directory. After you've downloaded all required packages, run the development server using the command \`npm run dev\`. 

The development server should serve the website on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Head there and check out what's going on! What do you see?

Let's dig into some code! The goal of the activity is to unlock the lock and change the pin. More specifically,

1. Find the code used to generate this page
2. Figure out what the code does
3. Find the passcode and unlock the lock
4. Change the lock pin to something else
5. Verify that the lock works with the new pin
