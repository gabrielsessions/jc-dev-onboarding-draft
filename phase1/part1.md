# Phase 1.1: Gitting Ready

Before you start coding, let's get our development environment set up. Here's what you'll need to start:
* GitHub Account
* Git
* Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)
* Code Editor

## GitHub
If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account at [github.com](https://github.com/).

What is GitHub?
> - GitHub is a popular platform used to store, share, and deploy software.
> - GitHub uses git (see below) to easily track and manage changes from multiple developers.
> - Owned by Microsoft

## Git
Do you already have git installed? You can check by running \`\`\`git --version\`\`\`. 

If the command returns an error (command not found), you can download a git installer here: [Git Downloads](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Verify that git is properly installed by running \`git --version\`

What is git? How is it different from GitHub?
> - Git is a version control system critical to modern software development
> - Git manages multiple versions of your code with branches. If multiple developers are working on the same project, each developer creates their own branch. When finished, changes are merged together into a main/master branch.
> - Changes are stored on branches through a process of **staging** and **committing**
> - It's Open Source

## Node.js and Node Package Manager (npm)
Node.js is a JavaScript runtme that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. 

Already have Node installed? Run \`node --version\` to check. Ideally you should be running a supported version of Node (v18 or higher). 

Don't have Node installed? Download and install the [LTS (long term support) version of Node here](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

Have an old version of Node installed and want to upgrade? You can install a newer version from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm?tab=readme-ov-file#intro) (Node Version Manager).

## Code Editor
There's a lot of editors and IDEs to choose from. If you have a preferred editor, feel free to use it. We generally recommend Visual Studio Code (VSCode) for newer developers. You can download VSCode from their [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

If you're more experienced developer and are looking for a specialized editor that has too many features, check out [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). It's free for students!
